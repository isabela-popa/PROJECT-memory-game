# Memory Game Project

## Introduction

The Memory Game project is a card matching game built to be 
usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

It consists of 8 pairs of cards, each pair with a different symbol on one side. They are arranged randomly on the board, with the symbol face down. You can flip over two cards in one move, to find the symbols that match.

## How to play
 
* To get started, open the game found at the following link https://isabela-popa.github.io/PROJECT-memory-game/;
* Click on one card at each step, in the order you choose, to flip it over and find the two identical symbols;
* At a time, you can you can have two cards facing up; 
* If the cards match, they stay open;
* If they don't match, both of them automatically flip back face down. 
* To finish the gamme, continue clicking on the other cards and revealing their symbol, until you match all of them.

Game starts when you click on the first card and a timer measures the time elapsed until all eight pairs of cards have been found.
Try to match the cards in less moves to get a better rating. One move equals two cards flipped over.
You can restart the game at any time by clicking the reset button situated on the upper right side of the game board.
